# dda_atmos

This sub-package will include my implementation of Ute Herzfeld's DDA-Atmos algorithm, described in [1](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL093473)


## Installation

The package can be installed by downloading this repository, navigating to the root folder (i.e. the one containing the folder dda_atmos) and executing the command

```python
pip install -e .
```

This allows for the implementation of the package to be editted whilst still allowing for it to be imported if its installed within an environment.
